## Siyong Ma

Hi, I am Siyong Ma, and now a Master candidate in Computer Science program in Northeastern University, Boston, MA. I earned my Bachelor's degree of Engineering in Software Engineering from [East China Normal University](http://www.ecnu.edu.cn), July, 2013.

I am now looking for 2015 spring CO-OP opportunity and summer internship. I am a good learner, and eager to participate in software development, web, or big data related work!

I am familiar with Python, Java, and C++. [Here](https://github.com/CiyoMa/) is my github page.
