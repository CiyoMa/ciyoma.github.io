Setting up Github.io page is super easy.

You just need create a public project with name: 

    [YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE_WITHOUT_PARANTHESIS].github.io


Then just write a index.html file for this project to set up your static personal GitHub.io page.

It does not look cool, right? How to deploy BootStrap? Use [JekyllBootStrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)!

MAKE SURE YOU ALREADY INSTALL RUBY ON YOUR MACHINE FOR DEVELOP USE.

Download JekyllBootStrap into your page folder.

Modify content in "_config.yml" to your profile information.

Try run jekyll on your machine under the project folder.

    jekyll serve

Much better, but still bad looking? How to beautify it?

Try cooler BootStrap icon nav-bar or modify it to transparent with a background image for your page!

Put following code into file "_site/assets/themes/twitter/css/style.css" to make your nav bar transparent

    .navbar {
       background-color: transparent;
       background: transparent;
    }

    .navbar-inner {
        background:transparent;
    }

    .navbar li { color: #000 } 


Then modify your page with a background image! File location: "_site/assets/themes/twitter/css/style.css"

    body { 
      background-image: url('YOUR_IMAGE_RELATIVE_PATH_UNDER_PROJECT_FOLDER');
      background-size: inherit;
    }


You can also modify the navi-bar information in "_includes/themes/twitter/default.html"
For me, I modify it with

    <li><a href="/archive.html">Archive</a></li>        
    <li><a href="/categories.html">Categories</a></li>
    <li><a href="/pages.html">Pages</a></li>
    <li><a href="/tags.html">Tags</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about.html">About</a></li>

where about.html is rendered from about.md I write under the project root folder.

Now, try to write new post!
New a file with name format "YYYY(YEAR)-MM(MONTH)-DD(DAY)-YOUR-PAGE-NAME-WITH-BLANK-REPLACED-BY-HYPHEN" under folder "_posts",
with format

    MAKR DOWN CONTENT

I'll recommend a great tool [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) to write MarkDown file! You can preview your MarkDown file online, similar to latex previewer [WriteLatex](http://writelatex.com).

Build your page with beatiful BootStrap css class, just by referring [BootStrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/components.html).

If you want to write latex math formula on your page, try [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/)!
You can just put following code into the header of html file "_includes/themes/twitter/default.html".

    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script>

Now try MathJax " \$ \$ s = e ^{x+1} \cdot \frac {1}{1+e^x} \$ \$ " (remove space between dollar sign), you'll get $$ s = e ^{x+1} \cdot \frac {1}{1+e^x} $$.

Big cong! Your blog has been set up! 

Enjoy!
